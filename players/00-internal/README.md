# Internal player

> Difficulty: 00/100

If `blackjack` is called with the `-i` option, it uses an _internal_ player to play against itself. By default it plays basic strategy, although it can read a text file with the strategy. Run 

```terminal
blackjack -i
```

and you will get the following report with the results of playing one million hands with basic strategy.
